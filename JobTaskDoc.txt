1) Using Laravel create an Artisan command called "import_file" that accepts two arguments - "path_to_file" and "id"



2) The command should parse the attached file "PAYARC_DDF" that has a fixed width text format and import the data into a mysql database.



3) On each line of the file there is a Record, that has two symbol unique Record Type which starts from position 18, for example: "DT", "P1", "P2", etc.

 Each individual Record Type has its own fixed width scheme that determines the Start and End of each column. You can find the full scheme specification in the attached file "import_file_specs.csv". 

The "id" parameter of the command uniquely identifies a file. Any consecutive import of a file with the same id should not result in duplicating the Records that have already been imported.
